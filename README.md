# apclientpp

C++ Archipelago multiworld randomizer client library. See [archipelago.gg](https://archipelago.gg/).


## Prerequisites

* gcc6 or msvc toolset v14.1 or newer on Windows
* gcc5 or clang3.3 or newer on other platforms
* std c++17 or newer for DefaultDataPackageStore on Windows (polyfill currently only for posix)
* std c++14 or newer for APClient (c++11 support needs a bit of rework)


## How to use

* add dependencies to your project
  * [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
  * [tristanpenman/valijson](https://github.com/tristanpenman/valijson)
    (unless disabled, see [Build Configuration](#build-configuration))
  * [black-sliver/wswrap](https://github.com/black-sliver/wswrap)
  * for desktop: [zaphoyd/websocketpp](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp)
  * for desktop: asio (and define ASIO_STANDALONE) or boost::asio
  * not all websocketpp versions are compatible to all asio versions
    * [try those](https://github.com/black-sliver/ap-soeclient/tree/master/subprojects) (download repo as zip and extract)
  * make sure to set up include paths correctly, the dependencies are all header-only
  * for desktop: link with openssl (`-lssl -lcrypto -Wno-deprecated-declarations`) and on windows `crypt32` and add a
    cert store for wss support or define `WSWRAP_NO_SSL` to disable SSL/wss support.
    See [SSL Support](#ssl-support) for more details.
* include apclient.hpp
* instantiate APClient and use its API
  * you can use `ap_get_uuid` from `apuuid.hpp` helper to generate a UUID
  * use `set_*_handler` to set event callbacks - see [callbacks](#callbacks)
  * call `poll` repeatedly (e.g. once per frame) for it to connect and callbacks to fire
  * use `ConnectSlot` to connect to a slot after RoomInfo
  * use `StatusUpdate`, `LocationChecks` and `LocationScouts` to send status, checks and scouts
  * use `Say` to send a (chat) message
  * use `Bounce` to send a bounce (deathlink, ...)
  * use `Get`, `Set` and `SetNotify` to access data storage api,
    see [Archipelago network protocol](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/docs/network%20protocol.md#get)
  * by default, we now use the shared data package cache in %LocalAppData%/Archipelago/Cache or ~/.cache/Archipelago.
    This can be changed by passing a custom APDataPackageStore into APClient.
* when upgrading from 0.3.8 or older
  * remove calls to `save_data_package` and don't save data package in `set_data_package_changed_handler`
* see [Implementations](#implementations) for examples
* see [Gotchas](#gotchas)


## Build Configuration

Some features/behaviors can be disabled/switched using compile time definitions.

Use
`-D<definition>` (gcc, clang),
`add_compile_definitions(<definition>)` (cmake),
`project properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions` (VS),
`/D<definition>` (vc command line) or
`#define <definition>` (in code, before include).

* `ASIO_STANDALONE` to use asio/`asio.hpp` directly, not via boost.
* `APCLIENT_DEBUG` write debug output to stdout.
* `AP_NO_DEFAULT_DATA_PACKAGE_STORE` to not use DefaultDataPackageStore automatically.
* `AP_NO_SCHEMA` disables schema validation.
  It's not required, shrinks the built binary and removes dependency on valijson.
* `AP_PREFER_UNENCRYPTED` try unencrypted connection first. Only useful for testing.
* `WSWRAP_SEND_EXCEPTIONS` to get exceptions when a send fails.
* `WSWRAP_NO_SSL` to disable SSL support. Only recommended for testing.
* `WSWRAP_NO_COMPRESSION` to disable compression. Only recommended for testing.


## When using Visual Studio for building

* follow steps mentioned above
* Set up Additional Include Directories for the dependencies
  * Project Properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories
    * Add subprojects\asio\include
    * Add subprojects\websocketpp
    * Add subprojects\wswrap\include
    * Add subprojects\json\include
    * Add subprojects\valijson\include
      (unless disabled, see [Build Configuration](#build-configuration))
    * Add openssl and zlib include directories if required (SSL and compression support)
* Set up Additional Link Libraries for openssl and zlib
  * Optional: Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories
    * Add folder where `libcrypto_*.lib` and `libssl_*.lib` are (for SSL support)
    * Add folder where `libz.lib` is (for compression support)
  * Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies
    * Add `libcrypto_*.lib` and `libssl_*.lib` (for SSL support)
    * Add `libz.lib` (for compression support)
  * Alternatively use `#pragma comment(lib, "lib_name")` in any cpp file if Library Directories are set correctly
* Add `/Zc:__cplusplus` to the command line
  * project properties -> C/C++ -> Command Line -> Additional Options
* Add `_WIN32_WINNT=0x0600` (or higher) to Preprocessor Definitions
  * project properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions
* If your code includes <windows.h>, you must also define the `WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN` preprocessor
  * project properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions
  * if your code relies on features outside the include scope of WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN, you can choose to include
    apclientpp.hpp before including windows.h, in this case you also need to define the `ASIO_NO_WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN`
    preprocessor

## SSL Support

APClient will automatically try both plain and SSL if SSL support is enabled and the supplied uri has no schema
(neither ws:// nor wss:// specified).

To add SSL/wss support on desktop, the following steps are required:

* update wswrap to the latest version
* add openssl (libssl and libcrypto) and optionally crypt32 to the "link libraries". Either static or dynamic.
* include the OpenSSL DLLs (if linked dynamically) and license file
* to make certificate verifaction work cross-platform
  * include a cert store file and its license, e.g. [curl's CA Extract](https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html)
  * load the cert store by passing the path as 4th argument to APClient's constructor
* apclient will try to load system certs, but this should only be used for testing:
  outdated Windows has outdated certs, macos/Linux without OpenSSL or with a different version won't find any certs


## Compression Support

To enable "permessage-deflate" compression support on desktop, update wswrap to 1.03.00 or newer and link with libz.

Context takeover is not supported.


## Callbacks

Use `set_*_handler(callback)` to set callbackes.

Because of automatic reconnect, there is no callback for a hard connection error.
If the game has to be connected at all times, it should wait for `slot_connected` and show an error to the user if that
did not happen within 10 seconds.
Once `slot_connected` was received, a `socket_error` or `socket_disconnected` can be used to detect a disconnect.

* socket_connected `(void)`: called when the socket gets connected
* socket_error `(const std::string&)`: called when connect or a ping failed - no action required, reconnect is automatic.
* socket_disconnected `(void)`: called when the socket gets disconnected - no action required, reconnect is automatic.
* room_info `(void)`: called when the server sent room info. send `ConnectSlot` from this callback.
* slot_connected `(const json&)`: called as reply to `ConnectSlot` when successful. argument is slot data.
* slot_refused `(const std::string&)`: called as reply to `ConnectSlot` failed. argument is reason.
* slot_disconnected `(void)`: currently unused
* items_received `(const std::list<NetworkItem>&)`: called when receiving items - previously received after connect and new over time
* location_info `(const std::list<NetworkItem>&)`: called as reply to `LocationScouts`
* location_checked `(std::list<int64_t>&)`: called when a local location was remoetly checked or was already checked when connecting
* data_package_changed `(const json&)`: called when data package (texts) were updated from the server
* print `(const std::string&)`: legacy chat message
* print_json `(const PrintJSONArgs&)`: colorful chat and server messages. pass arg.data to render_json for text output
* bounced `(const json&)`: broadcasted when a client sends a Bounce
* retrieved `(const std::map<std::string, json>&)`: called as reply to `Get`
* set_reply `(const json&)`: called as reply to `Set` and when value for `SetNotify` changed


## Gotchas

* `poll()` handles the socket operations, so it has to be called repeatedly while APClient exists.
* If desired, multi-threading has to be done by the caller. Events fire from within `poll()`. While inside poll other threads may not access the instance.
* Some versions of mingw may not define a compatible std::err
  * Commits from [this PR](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp/pull/479/files) can be cherry-picked in.
  * Forks of subprojects to be used directly as submodules are on the todo list.


## Build Time Considerations

apclientpp depends on some heavy header-only libraries.

Consider doing one or more of the following to improve build times:
* Include apclientpp in as few translation units (cpp files) as possible.
* Make use of precompiled headers:
  * If you include apclient.hpp directly from multiple cpp files, precompile it.
  * If another header file includes apclient.hpp that gets used by multiple translation units, precompile that instead.
* Disable valijson.
